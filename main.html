          No Man's Sky was first revealed at the VGX Awards in December 2013, and subsequently gained significant attention from the gaming press. Hello Games sought help from a publisher and got the interest of Sony Interactive Entertainment (then Sony Computer Entertainment). Sony offered to provide development funding but Hello Games only requested financial assistance for promotion and publication. Sony presented the game at their media event during Electronic Entertainment Expo 2014 (E3); until that point, no independently developed game has been demonstrated during these centre-stage events.</li>
        <li>
          Rumors circulated in the lead-up to the 2015 Paris Games Week in October 2015 that No Man's Sky would be released alongside Sony's press conference, but Murray and Sony denied these rumours. Instead, Sony used their press conference to announce the game's expected release in June 2016 for the PlayStation 4.

      <p>SPOILER WARNING</p>
      <p>The Traveller (the player character) wakes up on a remote planet with amnesia, and must locate their crashed starship. When they arrive, they are guided by their starship's computer, directing the character to make the necessary repairs to it, and collecting the resources needed to fuel a hyperspace jump to another planetary system. En route, they encounter individual members of three alien species, the Gek, the Korvax and the Vy'keen, that inhabit the galaxy. During their voyage, the Traveller is compelled by an unknown force to reach the centre of the galaxy. </p>

        The universe of No Man's Sky comprises 255 unique galaxies. In turn, these are composed of:
      <ul>
        <li><code>
            4.2 billion regions (the limit of a 32 bit integer)
            each of which contain more than 122 and up to roughly 580 star systems.</code></li>
        <li><code>
            All star systems feature from 2-6 planets and moons, and usually a single space station.</code></li>
        <li><code>
            There are about 18 quintillion possibilities (seeds) for planets (the limit of a 64 bit integer).</code></li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>The universe also naturally regenerates this means: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><code>During a universe regeneration, the player will not lose their inventory items, bases, or starships. The procedurally generated objects will have a new name and different stats, but their class remains.</code></li>
        <li><code>
            If any object is removed from the game, it will be removed from the player's inventories as well. It may be replaced by a newly introduced object to render it obsolete, such as the Obsolete Technology used in NEXT</code></li>

        In addition to its mixed response from critics, player reaction to the release version of No Man's Sky was generally negative in response to several issues at the game's launch, buoyed by early reactions from those that had played the game before its official release. Users expressed concern with the apparent lack of features and other issues associated with the PlayStation 4 launch, while many players on the Windows version via Steam and GOG.com gave the game negative reviews due to the poor graphics capabilities or inability to launch the game. Players were also disappointed at the apparent lack of features that Hello Games and Sony had stated in earlier announcements and interviews would be included in the game; a list initially compiled by members of the No Man's Sky subreddit consisting of all such features appeared around a week after launch.
      </p>
      <p>
        By October 2016, the game had one of the worst user-based ratings on Steam, with an aggregate "mostly negative" average from more than 70,000 users. At the 2017 Game Developers Conference, Murray admitted they have far underestimated the number of players that would initially get the game; using estimates from Inside and Far Cry: Primal, both released just before No Man's Sky, the studio had expected about 10,000 concurrent players at launch, but in actuality saw over 500,000 players across both PlayStation 4 and Windows, with about half coming from the Windows side. This overwhelmed their expected server capacity and overloaded their support team with bug reports and technical help, leading to the noted problems with communications within the release window.

        The fourth major update, No Man's Sky Next, was released for Windows and PlayStation 4 on 24 July 2018; this also coincided with No Man's Sky's release on Xbox One which included all updates including Next. Additionally, the Next update included support for Tencent's WeGame distribution platform in China, which Hello Games says hosts a significant number of No Man's Sky players.
      </p>
      <p>
        No Man's Sky Next was a significant update that Hello Games considered to be more representative of the game they wanted to release in 2016. The update included a full multiplayer experience, allowing up to four players to create and customize their in-game avatar and to join as allies to explore planets and star systems and build bases together, or as opponents to fight against each other. Bases are no longer limited to specific spots on a planet and now can be built nearly anywhere, including underwater, and such bases are visible to all other players of the game (on their respective platform). Players are able to assemble fleets of starships (called "frigates") to be used to send out on various missions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game's engine received a significant overhaul in how planets were procedurally generated as well as how they were rendered to the player. With the expanded multiplayer features, Next required players on consoles to have a PlayStation Plus or Xbox Live Gold service subscription to use the multiplayer elements. At launch, the GOG.com version of No Man's Sky Next lacked the multiplayer component, with GOG offering refunds within a limited window for anyone that had bought the game regardless of when that purchase was made.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following Next, Hello Games stated their plans to be more interactive with the community and provide more frequent updates, including weekly content with special events with community-driven goals that would provide all players with in-game currency to purchase in-game items, but otherwise free to all players and without microtransactions. The first such event was launched in late August 2018. Additionally, Hello Games launched the Galactic Atlas, a website that players can upload information about interesting discoveries they found in-game for other players to explore themselves.

        The game's official soundtrack, No Man's Sky: Music for an Infinite Universe by 65daysofstatic, was released on 5 August 2016, and received positive reviews from music critics. Andrew Webster of The Verge described the soundtrack as an extension of past 65daysofstatic albums, particularly from Wild Light, but with a greater science-fiction vibe to it, considering the track "Asimov" to be like "taking flight into a Chris Foss painting". Sam Walker-Smart for Clash rated the album 8 out of 10, considered the album one of 65daysofstatic's best, and that it was "apocalyptic, transcendental and drenched in a sense of pure epic-ness".

        No Man's Sky won the Innovation Award and was nominated for the Best Technology Award for the 2017 Game Developers Choice Awards. Murray and other members of Hello Games had attended the Game Developers Conference, but had not expected to win anything given the game's reputation by that point, and opted to go elsewhere for dinner when they were named the winners of the Innovation Award. The game was nominated for the Excellence in Technical Achievement for the 2017 SXSW Gaming Awards. The title was also named for the British Game award for the 13th British Academy Games Awards. PC Gamer named No Man's Sky its Best Ongoing Game award in 2017, and Shacknews considered it the Best Comeback in 2017, both praising the updates added in the year since its launch that had improved how one interacted with the game. The game was nominated for "Best Co-operative Game" and "Xbox Game of the Year" with No Man's Sky Next at the 2018 Golden Joystick Awards, and for "Best Ongoing Game" at The Game Awards 2018 and again in 2020 and won the award for "Most Evolved Game" at the 2019 SXSW Gaming Awards. At the Italian Video Game Awards, it was nominated for "Best Evolving Game". Beyond VR was nominated for "Best Game Expansion" and "Best VR/AR Game" at the 2019 Golden Joystick Awards, for the latter category at The Game Awards 2019, and for "Evolving Game" at the 16th British Academy Games Awards, won the award for "XR Game of the Year" at the 2020 SXSW Gaming Awards, and won "Best Ongoing Game" at The Game Awards 2020.
